## _These are computer graphics example projects_


I complete 5 experiment each one include two parts first one is basic and second one is a little bit advanced

- Open project in Netbeans or Webstorm as directory
- Run .html file 
- ✨See Results ✨

## Features

- Implementation done by using WebGL2. All programming assignments uses the shader-based functionality of WebGL2: at least one vertex shader and one fragment shader included.
- Pointer lock api to used for mouse input.
- Loading mesh  used in WebGL2
- WebGL2 transformations and basic GUI implented 
- WebGL2 texture and lighting used for create multiple textured objects

## Installation

All projects  requires [WebGL2](https://webgl2fundamentals.org) capabale browsers to run projects.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yunusemre482/Computer-Graphics.git
open .html file and click run
```
